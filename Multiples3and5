			<!-- This file provides a solution to Problem 1 on ProjectEuler.net which states:  "If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.  Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.-->

				<script>
						var result = 0;
						for (var counter = 0; counter < 1000; counter++) {
							if (counter % 3 === 0 || counter % 5 === 0)
								result = result + counter;
						}
						alert("The sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is:  " + result);

						/*
						Declare a global variable "result" and define it by making it equal to 0. 	The value of "result" begins at 0 when the function is called.
						
						Write a "for" loop function
							Declare a local variable "counter" and define it by making it equal to 0
								This initializes the loop at 0 (ie. it causes it to start at 0)
							Set the counter < 1000, which checks whether the loop should continue
								This establishes the limit of the loop
							Set counter to increment at ++ 
								Causes the value of counter to increase by an increment of 1 for following each loop
						
						Write an "if" statement wherein:
							The left expression "counter" is divided by 3 and the remainder is made equal to 0
							The right expression "counter" is divided by 5 and the remainder is made equal to 0
							Use the "or" operator to compare the values of the remainders.
						
						If the remainder of "counter" is 0 when divided by either 3, 5, or both the statement withing the code box will be executed.
						
						Write a statement that adds the value of "counter" to the value of "result" 
						"Result" is the value of the sum of all "counters" produced by each loop
						
						Call the "for" loop function using the function "alert" which retrieves the value caught by "result" and displays it in a dialog window in the browser environment
